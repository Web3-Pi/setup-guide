The main goal of this project is to provide a lightweight image creation suite that can be used to deploy Ethereum nodes on various devices from the Raspberry Pi family, including:

- [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) with 8GB of RAM
- [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with 8GB of RAM
- [Raspberry Pi Compute Mode (CM 4)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4) with 8GB of RAM

## Why Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi devices are a great choice for running an Ethereum Full/Archive/Staking node.

- Affordable: you can run a Full Ethereum EL / Ethereum CL nodes for less than $300
- Efficient: resources are focused on 1 task: run the node
- Low power consumption. An ARM64 boar consumes ~10W
- Small factor size: Great for running at home as it fits in any corner
- Great for running 24/7: Small, affordable and low power consumption

## Why Web3 Pi Images

- Plug&Play image, just flash & power up
- Based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for ARM64
- Automatic configuration (network, user account, etc)
- Automatic USB disk partitioning and formatting
- Manages and configure swap memory in order to avoid memory problems
- Automatically starts Ethereum 1.0 sync (Geth)
- Includes an APT repository for installing and upgrading Ethereum software
- Includes monitoring dashboards based on Grafana / InfluxDB
- Includes UFW firewall
