## Available Configurations

The Web3Pi node can be deployed in either a **[single-device](single-device.md)** or on **[dual-devices](pair-devices.md)**.

### Single-Device Mode

Single device mode is the simplest configuration. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use a Raspberry Pi 5.

**[Single-Device - Getting started](single-device.md)**

### Dual-Devices Mode

Paired devices mode requires additional configuration.  
The following combinations are supported:

- Two Raspberry Pi 4
- Two Raspberry Pi 5
- One Raspberry Pi 5 and one Raspberry Pi 4
- Any combination including Compute Module 4 (CM4)
